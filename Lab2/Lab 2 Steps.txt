Lab 2

- Note on Unity version
	- Since we're deleting the Library each time we submit or push to github, the actual Unity version shouldn't matter so long as the students use a 2022 version. I believe some labs have 2022.1.21, and I use 2022.3.14. But I have no problems rebuilding the libraries

- Intro
	- This lab is broken up into two parts, done over two weeks
	- There isn't TOO much to this lab, but it gives the lab instructors some time to explain the code
	- The goal of Lab 2 is to create the initial Seek behaviour that you'll need for the agent for Assignment 1
		- For A1, students will also have to add Flee, Arrive and Obstacle Avoidance
		- However, you can make any additions or alterations you want from the C++/SDL assignment
	- I have created two Seeks: one is a basic non-orienting Seek and the second is one I like much better and it links the orientation to the direction of motion - so the agent rotates towards the target but always moves forward

- Starting Lab
	- Make a Lab 2 subfolder in your GAME3001_Labs repo
	- Go to the Week 2 folder on Brightspace and get the Lab 2 start project and extract it into the Lab 2 folder
	- Make your first push to GitHub
	- Explore the couple of GameObjects in the starting scene and spend 30 minutes talking about The Wrath of Khan
		- No, just kidding! Maybe 5-10 minutes will be fine. Hey, the students need some context, right

- Adding GameObjects
	- In the Prefabs folder, there are prefabs for the target called planet, and the Starship Parent (our agent)
		- The target is a planet, not the Enterprise, but that epic battle will be coming in a future lab!
	- Add both prefabs to the scene, putting the ship at the bottom left and the target in the top right
	- There should only be Rigidbody2Ds and colliders on the objects
	- Note that for the starship, the sprite is actually in the child object
	- Push changes

- Adding the click and drag functionality (ClickDragScript)
	- I have decided that an interesting feature would be to have the user be able to click and drag the GameObjects around instead of moving them with sliders or buttons
	- Much of this lab might be taken up by creating the script and its functionality
	- Create the ClickDragScript with the students and add the code in the completed script
	- Attach the script to the Canvas for convenience and test it by clicking and dragging the two objects around
	- Push changes

- Creating the AgentObject base script
	- The starship parent is going to have a script called Starship eventually that will inherit from AgentObject
	- Create the AgentObject script, explaining how any autonomous agent will have a Target
	- I opted to use a property called TargetPosition to review properties with students
	- It gets and sets the .position of the target Transform
	- Push changes

- If there's time left, you can do the "Starting the Starship script" from Part 2 here

- No submission for Part 1
	- Note that to simplify things, you can wait until Part 2 is done before asking students to submit the entire Lab 2

Lab 2 - Part 2

- Starting Lab
	- Have the students continue their lab from last week. If they don't have a Part 1, they'll have to watch any video that was made. If they don't attend the labs, it's their fault

- Starting the Starship script 
	- Create a new C# script called Starship and put it on the ship parent. Make sure it derives from AgentObject
	- Create the smaller Seek, adding the necessary fields - I think movementSpeed is the only one
	- Make sure to add the Start and Update behaviours and in Update, invoke Seek
	- You may spend any remaining time explaining the code and demoing the Seek
	- Push changes

- Continuing the Starship script
	- Part 2 may not take the entire 2 hours, now that I think about it, but you'll have plenty of time to play around with the new Seek, tweaking the different speeds.
	- Add the new SeekForward method, and add any required fields
	- I imagine some time will be needed to explain this method
	- Add the OnTriggerEnter2D method, and make sure to set a new tag on the target GameObject called Target

- For students to add
	- For 2% of 8 for the lab, students must add a button that restarts the Seek behaviour
	- It should reset the positions of the ship and target
	- It will mostly be up to them how to figure this out, but you can give hints as required

- Check the Lab Report for Lab 2. Students just have to highlight what level they managed to complete for each item and hand it in with their Lab 2.
